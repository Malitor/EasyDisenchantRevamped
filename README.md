== Easy Disenchant Revamped ==

This project is open-source and forked from the original project on GitHub here: https://github.com/Kruithne/EasyDisenchant

With the approval of Kruithne I was allowed to make a fork and bring it out as EasyDisenchant2

This add-on provides a quality-of-life interface for disenchanting items. To access the interface, simply type '/disenchant' in chat, or use the button provided on the enchanting trade skill window.
